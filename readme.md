Secret Sharing
==============
Secret sharing scheme implemented in C++ and Python.

In this scheme, the programme creates n shares of the secret that can be appropriately distributed by the dealer in an (n, n) threshold scheme. Unanimous consent is required for the secret to be reconstructed - all shares are required.

This repo is primarily a learning exercise for C++, Python and basic cryptography - it should not be used to share important secrets.
